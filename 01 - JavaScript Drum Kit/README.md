## Notes

HTML and CSS was already written only JS was added.

learnt new event listener event named "transitionend" which will be very useful for transformations and removing classes when they end... not sure about other use cases.

Also a useful reference if I ever want to work with SFX, very niche use case. Should probably add these notes to notion as well so I can build an encyclopedia on projects ive worked on and be able to reference them again for later use.
