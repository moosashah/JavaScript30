## Notes

Really cool idea of allowing users to control variables and have it update CSS variables..
It feels like this course will just end up being learning different methods and I can add them to my notes
and have them in my backpocket so when the issue arises I know the solution ahead of time. That or
since I know what can be done, It'll help with ideation.
